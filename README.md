Listed here are my work on various topics related to data science. Each project is its own repository which can be accessed via their respective links.

## Predictive Models
### predicting bugfixtime
`linear regression` `decision tree` `random forest` `feature engineering` `NLP` `TF-IDF` `utility function`  
This project aims to predict the time taken to fix a bug given the information available when the bug was first filed such as severity, bug description and project name. I started with 3 regression models and pick the best one based on accuracy score, the moedels' performance measured by a utility function, and the performance with hypothetical constraints.

## Clustering Problems
### identifying hearthstone card packages
`k-means` `TSNE` `dimensionality reduction` `PCA` `data visualziation`  
This project looks at a dataset of Hearthstone decks and attempt to cluster 1) the decks using their compositions, and 2) the cards using the decks they are included in. CLustering the cards reveal what cards are usually included with each other and hence implying that they synergize well. This is called a 'package' and knowing the packages in Hearthstone can help to highlight good deckbuilding options.
